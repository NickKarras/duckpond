# duckpond

A semantic pond for content delivery.

## Introduction

A [semantic data lake](http://cacm.acm.org/news/200095-the-data-lake-concept-is-maturing/fulltext) can be thought of a set of resources annotated with semantics (i.e., triples or quads).  In the context of big data, a "data lake" is a massive repository of data, structured or unstructured, of which we gain knowledge of its contents by examining the semantic graphs derived from their contents.

That's a big idea.  This project is about a *semantic data lake* at a much smaller scale: a pond. I also like ducks and so it is a *duck pond*.

We can paddle around in our content, just like a duck, and harvest a bit knowledge to derive local value.  In this case, we use the semantic pond to understand the content, its inter-relations, ordering, and other such content relations.  From that, we can derive a useful presentation on the Web.

The architecture also utilizes Github as a basis for publishing.  That is not a requirement but it lessens the infrastructure and allows me to keep revision histories and all the other goodies that come with git and Github.

## Demonstrations

I use this technology to run my wee website: [my corner of the web](http://www.milowski.com/).
